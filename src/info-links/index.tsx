      How come some servers show more details than others?
    </Title>
    <p>
      Ultimately, servers can show as much or as little as they want. If you
      want to show more detailed information on your server, set{" "}
      <Code>enable-status</Code> and <Code>enable-query</Code> to{" "}
      <Code>true</Code> in your <Code>server.properties</Code>. Remember though,
      this is information shared to the public. Check that there is nothing
      unintentional being exposed or that you have measures to protect your
      server if needed.
    </p>
    <Title order={5}>
      Why do some player lists look weird, incomplete, or empty?
    </Title>
    <p>
      As above, servers can show what they like. Some servers take the
      opportunity to show ads, extra server information, a subset of players, or
      maybe, no players at all. As of Minecraft 1.18, players are able to
      opt-out of server queries, and hence will not be shown in the player list.

    <p>
      This website costs me zero dollars per year to run as it relies on
      existing free services. While it's a kind notion, you hang on to it for a
      rainy day ðŸ˜‰. If you really want to contribute, the code is open-source on{" "}
