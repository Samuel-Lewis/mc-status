    <Title level={4}>Why is my server not showing up?</Title>
    <P>
      There are a few reasons your server may not be showing up
      <ol>
        <li>The server maybe offline</li>
        <li>
          The server <T code>enable-status</T> may be set to <T code>false</T>
        </li>
        <li>
          There is a bug in my code ðŸ˜ž. You can raise an{" "}
          <Link href="https://github.com/Samuel-Lewis/mc-status/issues">
            issue on the GitHub repo
          </Link>
          .

    </P>
    <Title level={4}>
      How come some servers show more details than others?
    </Title>
    <P>
      Ultimately, servers can show as much or as little as they want. If you
      want to show more detailed information on your server, set{" "}
      <T code>enable-status</T> and <T code>enable-query</T> to <T code>true</T>{" "}
      in your <T code>server.properties</T>. Remember though, this is
      information shared to the public. Check that there is nothing
      unintentional being exposed or that you have measures to protect your
      server if needed.
    </P>
    <Title level={4}>Why do some player lists look weird or empty?</Title>
    <P>
      As above, servers can show what they like. Some servers take the
      opportunity to show ads, extra server information, a subset of players, or
      maybe, no players at all.
    </P>
    <Title level={4}>How do I donate or contribute?</Title>
    <P>
      This website costs me zero dollars per year to run as it relies on
      existing free services. While it's a kind notion, you hang on to it for a
      rainy day ðŸ˜‰. If you really want to contribute, the code is open-source on{" "}
      <Link href="https://github.com/Samuel-Lewis/mc-status">GitHub</Link>.
